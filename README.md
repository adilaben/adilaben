# Junior Software Engineer & NFT Illustrator

I'm a junior software engineer and NFT illustrator with a passion for building projects that make a positive impact on the world. I specialize in web and mobile development, as well as blockchain-based artwork on the Ethereum network. 

I have experience working with various programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, Java and Solidity. I also have a background in graphic design and illustration, which I use to create unique digital artwork. 

My goal is to combine my software engineering and illustration skills to create projects that not only look great, but also have a positive impact on the world. I'm always looking for new and exciting projects to work on, so if you have an idea for something I could help with, please don't hesitate to reach out via email: adilabendahou@gmail.com!
